# AL4tO 
AL4tO expands to Android Launcher For the Old.

Smart phone UIs and the elderly just dont seem to gel well. Expecially the crowd that just chucking their Nokia 3310s etc coz they now want WA, Telegram etc to video chat with their grand kids.

However everything about the smart phones "SMART" UI gives the elderly the heeby jeebies.

No matter how much I tried to tone down the animation, increase the font and icon sizes, reduce the clutter, popups etc and blocked features it still seems bad.

And the elderly apps out there presently... Ive tried some of them free ones and the paid ones... and they fare pathetically for me and my moms needs.

And PAID!!! 

Takes a mean, sadistic, and perverse capitalistic mindset to want to program an app for the infirm, and then make them pay or squeeze their family members who just want their parents to be comfortable using a smart phone.

Thats just mean, but hey thats just how I feel.

So this is an attempt to create a lean Android Launcher thats first and foremost for one person my 83 yrs old mom.

Hopefully its gonna benifit someone else too...
